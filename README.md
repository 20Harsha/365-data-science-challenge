* Data preparation and analysis: I used Power BI for data cleaning, data modelling, identifying useful insights. 
* Data Visualization: Creating useful KPI’s, Parameters, charts, tables in order to analyze student’s engagement with the 365 data science platform. 

# Questions to be answered using dashboard:

* What percentage of students are onboarded?
* Which are the top 5 courses most watched by students? How are they rated?
* How do the students engage with the platform based on user type (free or paid)?
* Which subscription type most student’s prefer?
* What is the percentage of student’s engagement for exams, quizzes and lessons?
* Which are the top 5 countries by number of users?
* Which are the countries with the most students registered? Does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
* Compare total minutes watched V/s average minutes watched montly?
* How many students register each month? What fraction of these students are also onboarded?
